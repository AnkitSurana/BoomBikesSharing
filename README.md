## General Information
- This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes after Covid-19 lockdowns.
- The business problem involves assisting BoomBikes in understanding factors affecting bike demand to optimize their business strategy.
- The [dataset](day.csv) consists of daily bike demand data across the American market, with features such as weather conditions, season, and user types.

## Conclusions
- The model identified significant variables influencing bike demand.
- Insights from the model can guide strategic decisions to meet customer expectations post-lockdowns.
- Evaluation metrics such as R-squared score on the test set validate the model's predictive capability.
